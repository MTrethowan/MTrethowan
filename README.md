Iâ€™m an Electronics Tech and Design Engineer for a small company, which I have worked for since 1998. My programming expertise is in VB.NET, PICBasic Pro and Micropython. Some of the products I designed use components no longer available, requiring me to redesign those projects. The Raspberry Pi Pico is my choice for use in the first re-engineering project. I chose MicroPython as the language for that first project as an excuse to learn Python. It turns out that Micropython doesn't follow Python that closely, and documentation and examples are weak, IMHO. As I learn some tricks, I decided to create project boards based on my project requirements and share those, along with code examples, to help others design their own code. Understand that I am a beginner in Python, having only stared coding with it in April 2023. The code will be very basic but should help others in figuring out their own code. As these projects develop I will make the boards that I use available from Seeed Studio/Fusion. Thank you.
