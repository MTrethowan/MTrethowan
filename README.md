Hi, I’m @MTrethowan
I am an Electronics Tech and Design Engineer for a small company that I have worked for over 24 years.
For the last 22 years I have been programming in VB.Net professionally. Also, I  also program PIC 
micrcontrolers in PicBasic Pro and have products at installations all over the U.S. and a few foriegn installations.
I am moving my projects to C# and eventually C++ in an effort to move my products from the Windows environment
to the Linux environment. in doing so I am learning these programming environments and have decided to make available
stripped down versions of routines that I have found useful and have seen others struggle with over the years. 

These routines will be in the form of Visual Studio Solutions containing the example in VB, C# and possably C++
These may not be the best way to do these routines and don't mind if others point that out to me. To learn is to live.

"Change is the only constant in the universe"
Thank you.
